	This Project is a recreation of the original Legend of Zelda game released for the 
	Nintendo Entertainment System on the 22nd of August 1987.
	It was realised on the E2LP FPGA board supplied to us by the Computer Electronics Company RT-RK.

The Legend of Zelda is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Nintendo and designed by 
Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. Set in the fantasy land of Hyrule, the plot centers on a boy named Link,
the playable protagonist, who aims to collect the eight fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom in order to rescue 
Princess Zelda from the antagonist, Ganon. During the course of the game, the player sees Link from a top-down
perspective and must navigate him through the overworld and several dungeons, defeating enemies and finding secrets along the way.
